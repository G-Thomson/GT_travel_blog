      <description>Turns out the phrase is false and that it does rain in Spain. Neverthless I ventured out and caught the subway to the Gothic Quarter which is the old part of the city with ver narrow streets and allyways. There is an interesting range of shops including a arcade with only pop-culture related stores. There were entire stores related to Harry Potter, Steampunk, Dragonball Z and the Rubics cube. Nevertheless not much opened till 10-11am so I wandered around and found my way to the Parc de la Ciutadella and the Parliament de Catalunya.</description>

      <description>Finally arrived after a very long trip. I didn&amp;rsquo;t end up having much time in either Sydney or Dubai but overall the flights were ok and I watched a few movies. Mostly about women trying to change their boyfriends and it not working. Anyway, I got to Barcelona and got a bus to the centre of town. I then got the subway to the AirBnB I am staying at. The woman here is very nice and helpful and the area looks interesting to walk around.</description>
