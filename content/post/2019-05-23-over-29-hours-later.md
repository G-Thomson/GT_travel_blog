Finally arrived after a very long trip. I didn't end up having much time in either Sydney or Dubai but overall the flights were ok and I watched a few movies. Mostly about women trying to change their boyfriends and it not working. Anyway, I got to Barcelona and got a bus to the centre of town. I then got the subway to the AirBnB I am staying at. The woman here is very nice and helpful and the area looks interesting to walk around. Going to have a sleep now.
