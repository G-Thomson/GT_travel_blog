I got up early today and packed my things and caught the subway across Barcelona to the train station. I had to go through security as it turned out the train I was getting was a high speed one (300 km/h). It was mostly a lot of old people on the train with me but it was a nice train and I could look out the window, read and listen to podcasts for the six hours it took to get to Malaga. Spain is very dry without a lot of tall trees however the buildings all look like postcards with terracotta rooves. Nevertheless it was interesting to see the countryside where I saw a lot of grapes (short varieties) and olives grown. In the south I saw some oranges and sunflower fields too.

Mark picked me up at the train station and the timeng was good as Alex had flown in at the same time. We then drove 40mins to Nerja where the house is which is a nice white stucco townhouse. I think we are going to walk to the beach later on tonight. Harry flies in tomorrow.
