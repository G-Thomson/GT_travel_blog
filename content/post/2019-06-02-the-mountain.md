Today Harry wanted to walk up Pico del cielo which is a mountain above Nerja. It is 1508m tall (thats much taller than Ben Nevis the tallest mountain in Britian). It was 3 hours up and 3 hours down and very very steep. In the spanish sun it was very tough but we made it to the top to get some great views over the area. A highlight was an apricot tree growing along the track which had lots of fruit on it.

I am very tired and dehydrated. I am drinking as much water as I can. In the evening we went to a italian restraunt with Mark and had great pizzas.
