Today I walked to Sant Pau Recinte Modernista which was one of the main hospitals here untill 2009. It was very interesting as its a large complex all in the Art Nouveau style. A lot of thought had been put into how patients should be treated and how the buildings could facilitate that. It was very pretty too. Afterwards I went to Laberint d'Horta Park in the north of the city which I think used to be a stately home. It has a formal garden with lots of neoclassical elements including a large hedge maze.

I then went to  Mount Tibidabo which you reach by cable car. It allows panoramic views of the city and for some reason also has an amusement park at the top. More interestingly the mountain also has Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor, a very distict looking minor basilica with ornate decorations both in and outside.
