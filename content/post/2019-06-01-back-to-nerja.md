Today we had breakfast at the hotel in the mountains and then drove back to Nerja. We then walked along the beach for an hour or so and went to the restraunt we went to on my first full day here. On the way back Harry, Alex and I walked through the town and went swimming on the sandy beach. The water is very warm. We got ice-cream afterwards.

We went to a fancy restraunt in the evening.
