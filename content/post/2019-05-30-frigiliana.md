Today we got the bus up the road to the village of Frigiliana which is an inland village built into the hillside. It is a picturesque village with white buildings and terracotta rooves and lots of small winding (and steep!) streets which are too narrow to drive around. We had a nice lunch (I had black pasta) and walked to the top of the hill overlooking the town. We met some tame donkeys at the top. We then walked down into a river valley and followed the river out towards the sea and back to Nerja. It took about an hour and a half.

In the evening Mark and Harry made a very nice BBQ dinner.
