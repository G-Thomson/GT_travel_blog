We took another trip outside of Fes today, this time to the Middle Atlas Mountains. We were the only ones on the tour. This was a visit to an area which is not really geared for tourism but we got to see how people live in small town Morocco. In the first tow we visited a cave which was the traditional home of a Berber family. The family have since incorporated it into their house built on top of the cave but it was neat to see inside, the man who lived there was very welcoming and showed us the rugs his grandmother makes by hand and gave us some mint tea.

We then continued on up into the mountains and visited a couple of other towns. They were noticibly wealthier and are apparently a popular holiday destination. While it was 28 degrees outside today it also snows here so the houses all have steep rooves, they call it the Switzerland of Morocco. The highlight of the day was walking in the ceder forest which along with woodpeckers and other birds are home to Barbary macaque which were fed by  other tourists there.

When we returned in the evening we went out for dinner and met a nice American lady called Tina.
