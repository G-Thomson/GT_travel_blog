We started the day with a nice breakfast provided by the Riad we are staying at. Then we got a guide to give us a tour of the Medina. The Medina is the ancient quarter of the city founded 1200 years ago and a UNESCO world heritage site. It is the largest Medina in the world with >9500 small allyways with houses, shops and markets. Unlike other cities the Medina in Fes has not been modernised so cars are not allowed. It thus feels like it was hundreds of years ago. One thing tourist guides dont tell you is that there are kittens everywhere, on every street there are at least 3 or four hanging about.

We got to see several Madrases which a notable dormatories and schools which have amazing mosaics and carved architecture. There is also the oldest university in the world. We also went to several handicrafts that Fes is well known for. These include the fabric district where they spin and weave wool, cotton, velvet and agave silk on a hand loom, also the copper and bronze metalwork, engraving, fabric dying, spices (including argen oil). We also went to the tannery which was amazing and Harry and I both got leather jackets, mine felt very warm and I thought it would be good for New Haven. While they were expensive (mine was NZ$470) I think they are of very good quality and in anycase we bartered the equivalent of NZ$500 off the price between us so I think we did quite well.

We also got to go to a prominant ceramic company factory where they make anything (from crockery, to cookwear to tables to fountains) starting from clay all the way to the finished products. They do all the paintingfreehand. What was most impressive was the mosaics, they cut out all the pieces from tiles using sharp hammers, before assembling the images.

We got a taxi to the ceramic place. In Spain the most difficult thing about people driving on the right hand side of the road is roundabouts as I always instinctively thought we should be going clockwise instead of anticlockwise. In Morocco this is not such a big deal as although they nomilally drive in the right you seem to be able to go either way around a roundabout.
