Turns out the phrase is false and that it does rain in Spain. Neverthless I ventured out and caught the subway to the Gothic Quarter which is the old part of the city with ver narrow streets and allyways. There is an interesting range of shops including a arcade with only pop-culture related stores. There were entire stores related to Harry Potter, Steampunk, Dragonball Z and the Rubics cube. Nevertheless not much opened till 10-11am so I wandered around and found my way to the Parc de la Ciutadella and the Parliament de Catalunya. I also walked to the Arc del Triomf.

I then visited the Museu d'historia de Barcelona which documented the founding of the city by the Romans in the 1st century BC and had a large excavated archeological site to walk around.

In the afternoon I went to the Sagrada Familia basillica which is still under construction. Its a real tourist trap but it is the most impressive building I have visited. It is very ornate and a real progression from the typical gothic cathedral. Crazy that it was only consecrated in 2010.

Anyway, I have perhaps walked too much today and my ankle is sore.
