Nothing much to report today. We alked for an hour or so through the town and along the beach and had lunch on the beach. I had a whole fish. Alex and I then wandered through the town a bit more and got ice-cream.  I also got a new hat and decent sunscreen. However the heat really sapped my energy and we just laid around all afternoon. 

Had dinner at a chinese restraunt tonight which was nice as Harry arrived. It is nice to see him and I look forward to talking to him more.
