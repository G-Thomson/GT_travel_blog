Today was a slower day as it is Eid, the day after Ramadan. It is a national holiday and consequently almost everything is closed. We tried to walk to some nearby gardens but they were locked so we wandered around a bit and found the Royal Palace Dar El Makhezen. We took some photos outside its impresive gates but some guards wanted us to move along. We thus walked around its entire perimeter and up a hill to the Marinid Tombs which are some old ruins. We got a good view of the city from there.

When we came down we came to the far side of the medina and walked through untill we recognised where we were. Harry brought a new leather bag and got a good price I think. We bartered down to 1000 dirhams (~$150) from 3000 dirhams mainly thanks to me leaving the shop and they shopkeeper having to run after us. He then took us to a carpet workshop where we were shown the different types of Moroccan carpet. Interestingly many of these handicraft industries operate as co-operatives of families. They don't have to pay tax this was and we think it is to preserve the character of the medina.

At about 2pm we came back to our Riad and did some reading. I actually did the review I was asked to do and wrote >2100 words (I said the experiment was good but the paper needed major revisions). We had dinner at the house tonight.
