Today we drove up into the mountains on southern Spain past lots of small villages. We have come to the highest village, Trevelez. This is a very steep town. The main industry is hams so alot of the buildings have large numbers of salted hams drying and the streets smell of ham. We are not sure where the pigs are. We walked up the valley which looked very pretty as the area is a lot more lush than the dry lowlands. It was interesting to see a lot of the animals as the farmers only have small numbers. The cows all have cowbells.

We have a nice characterful hotel to stay in. All in all a good day.
