Today I walked up the hill from my AirBnB to Parc Guell, a failed and unfinished housing estate designed by Gaudi. It was very popular but I am not sure why. It looks like it was the inspiration for Disneyland but is actually quite small with just a few key things to see. While small, it is interesting but I don't think it is worthy of its UNESCO  World Heritage Site status.

I then took the subway to the Museu Nacional D'Art de Catalunya which was really cool. It is this huge regal palace with massive fountains on the slopes of the montjuic hill. Inside there was some great exhibitions of medieval art, notably Romanesque murals which had been transplanted from rural churches in Catalonia dating from the 12-13th centuries. There was a modern section too but I didn't get to see that as I didn't realise it closed at 3pm. 

So I then walked over the montjuic hill, past the 1992 Olympic stadium and through the parks. I walked down into town and up the tourist streets.
