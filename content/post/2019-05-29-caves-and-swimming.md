We walked to a neighbouring village called Marro today. The have ancient limestone caves which were inhabited by neaderthals. It was a neat cave complex although unfortunately we didn't get to see any cave paintings as light can destroy them. Nevertheless on the way there we walked past a number of greenhouses growing tomatos, chillies and beans. There are also peach trees, lots of avacados and what looks like sugercane. There are lots of little birds around and I found some quite large frogs in a irigation pond.

After the caves we went to the beach. The sand was very hot and harry and I went swimming and the water was very warm. We then walked home in the afternoon till late this evening where we walked into town and had tapas at Mark's favourite bar before getting Nepalese food for dinner.
