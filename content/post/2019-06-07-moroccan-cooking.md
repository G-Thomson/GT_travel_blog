Today we signed up for a cooking class at the riad we are staying at. Thus we started the day going out into the medina with the cook and receptionist of the riad to but ingrediants. After that we walked into the new town which is the modern part of Fes. On the way we stopped off at a free vet clinic for donkeys to see if we could have a look around but it was closed. Turns out that Fridays are the holy day for Muslims and also almost everything is closed following the end of Ramadan. 

We continued on and went to a bookshop at the American Language College and walked up and down the large boulevard of the new town. However there was not much open. So we walked back to the medina and had some fruit for lunch (look at the cabinet in the photo below). Harry then took me to a Haram which is like a spa. They soak you in water, soap you down and then scrub away all the dead skin. There is also a sauna. Aftwewards we both got massages.

We then came back to the riad and learnt to make a morocccan meal. The salads we made were really good. There was a tomato and aubegine one, a courgette and garlic one and a green pepper and lemon one. We made beef targine and the orange custurd for desert. It was interesting although I found peeling tomatos difficult. We also cut out individual sgments of oranges for desert too. It tasted great!
