Today was a day in transit. Mark drove us to the Malaga airport and we flew to Bordeaux on Ryanair. We then rechecked my bag and got an AirArabia flight to Fes, Morroco. Both flights were just under 2 hours but all up the travel took all day. Unfortunately my bag was overweight by 4kg so we had to pay to get it on each flight!!

When we got to Fes the airport was very flash and it is noticibly hotter here. A driver met us at the airport. He drove us to our AirBnB, or "Riad", and told us what to do while here. The place we are staying is very cool, it is in the middle of the ancient Medina quarter so we parked maybe 200m away and had to walk through narrow allyways to a door in the wall. Down a corridor it opens into a square cloister which is the house, or "Riad", we are staying at. It is very atmospheric with lots or ornate carving and tropical plants. The people were very friendly and we got a traditional Moroccan dinner. Our room is on the third floor with large wall size widows with shutters and ornate metal grates.
