I have seen more donkeys in the last couple of days than the rest of my life. We were greeted by a number of them ridden by small children when we stopped off to look at a resevoir on our van ride to Volubis and Meknes.

Volubis is the ruins of an ancient Roamn city which was very wealthy on account of the large number of olives grown in the area which they pressed to make olive oil. The ruins are very large with many pillars and mosaics restored. Along with a few others we got a guide to take us around. It is also near the town Moulay Idriss du Zerhoun which we drove through, this is perhaps the holiest village in Morroco as it is the tomb of the prophet who brought Islam to Morocco.

We then went to the town of Meknes which is another city like Fes. We had lunch with some others touring the country and then wandered around the town. They have a Medina like Fes but it was largely closed due to the end of Ramadan. Nevertheless we found a man who was very keen to show us around, I gather he works for the local council wdoing something to do with visitor information. Anyway, he was very passionate about his city and gave us a tour pointing out lots of things we would not have seen otherwise. He explained the design of the medina (fountains, haram or baths and bakeries are important), showed us the back of the public baths as well as wood sculptors and local atrisans who beat silver onto iron. Interestingly everyone paints their hous based on their ethnicity but everyone thinks of themselves as Moroccan. He also told us some of the history of a terrible mosque disaster ten years ago and took us to the tombs of prominant people from the city (poets, scientists, etc.). We were fortunate to run into him.

We also learned that there are so many cats because they are sacred in Islam and there is a story in the Koran about one giving birth on the Prophets bed.

In the evening, back in Fes, we went to a cool, trendy Moroccan restaurant called The Hidden Garden that Harry had read about.
